# Build systems demo app

This is a demo application for my [slides about build systems](http://anxolerd.github.io/kpi-slides-buildsystems).
This app was remastered after the demonstration to look better and have a verbose guide.

## Some conventions
1. This is a small application that consists of
    - 3 html pages
    - some simple javascript
    - styles written in `stylus`
2. Branching
    - There is a project structure in the `master` branch.
    - `Gulp` powered version is in the `gulp` branch. There is also a guide for setting up [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com) build system
